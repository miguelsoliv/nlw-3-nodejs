# Next Level Week #3 (Rocketseat)

The API created by Rocketseat is able to create, list and show orphanages with their related images (if any). This repo provided some bonus features and/or changes to improve it, making it more unique and original

## 🎊 Bonus

* Using eslint + prettier
* Created `.gitignore`
* Using `.gitkeep` in `uploads` folder
* Interfaces for views
* Parsing data in POST route for orphanage creation (all data provided by `multipart/form-data` is a `string` or `string[]`)
* PUT route to update orphanage data
* Moved validation data process and divided into middleware and validator functions
* Validating data from route using [celebrate](https://github.com/arb/celebrate) and then validating data using [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) (the Yup validating process could easily be removed or changed to avoid duplicated code, but will remain to serve as an example)
